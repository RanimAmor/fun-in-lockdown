If your partner guesses the password then your team wins the points of the round, but if he doesn't, then it's the other team’s turn. If their team gets the password they get the points. If the other team also doesn’t get the word you get another try. So this goes on for 3 times till someone gets the password and then the next round starts. It's a really entertaining game to play with your friends. **Pro Tip**: Turn this into a drinking game and you'll maximize the fun!*([download it here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.androidmate.password_game))*
* [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/): The goal of this game is to guess the location of a specific spot on the globe presented to you via google maps street view. You can either play alone, or with friends. The closer your guess to the selected location, the more point you gather. The winner of the game is the person with the most points at the end of a specified number of rounds.
* [The Wiki Game](http://thewikigame.com/): In this game, you have to navigate around wiki pages and guess. You start from a specific wikipedia page and within a specified time limit, you have to go to another target wikipedia page using the available hyperlinks.

* [Among Us](https://www.bluestacks.com/apps/action/among-us-on-pc.html): The game takes place in a space-themed setting, in which players each take on one of two roles, most being Crewmates, and a predetermined number being Impostors. The goal of the Crewmates is to identify the Impostors, eliminate them, and complete tasks around the map; the Impostors' goal is to covertly sabotage and kill the Crewmates before they complete all of their tasks. Players suspected to be Impostors may be eliminated via a plurality vote, which any player may initiate by calling an emergency meeting (except during a crisis) or reporting a dead body. Crewmates win if all Impostors are eliminated or all tasks are completed whereas Impostors win if there is an equal number of Impostors and Crewmates, or if a critical sabotage goes unresolved.

### Musical Instruments
You are never actually too old to learn to play an instrument you have always liked. It is a perfect break from your laptop's screen.

#### Guitar
You will get surprised from how easily you can produce nice sounds. All you need to begin is:
* a [tuning app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ovelin.guitartuna&hl=en&gl=US)
* a set of strings
* a footstool (recommended for classical guitar)
* and of course the guitar

You can either teach yourself with a huge collection of online tutorials and tabs or find a teacher and have online lessons. You can check out [Kurt Berg's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOSmaT73sJrjOmf6PHjxVAQ) YouTube channel for easy beginner tutorials. [Sky Guitar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDlfXUX_wYgyfiXbfQh96Eg) also has a good deal of classical guitar tutorials for different levels.

There are 3 major guitar types:

* *Nylon acoustic (classical):* It produces a mellow sound and it's ideal for beginners, as the strings are easy to pick and it is lightweight and cheap. However, it has wider fretboard.
* *Steel string acoustic:* The strings produce a brighter tone and they are ideal for strumming. However, building calluses can be really painful for beginners.
* *Electric:* You will need at least an amp as the sound is produced from electric signals. It also uses steel strings and it is a bit heavier. Nonetheless, it is great for creativity with many technics and effects.

#### Piano

While there is no doubt that having a good traditional teacher can be helpful, the fact is you can teach yourself how to play piano/keyboard very effectively by attending online piano lessons or watching online guides. You can check out [MangoldProject's Piano Lessons for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=827jmswqnEA&list=PLP9cbwDiLzdL6IS4-rmzR42ghq3T56XnK), which is a helpful step by step guide for learning to play on a keyboard.

#### Ukulele

It really doesn't matter how old or young you are, and even if you’ve never played music before in your life, you can learn how to play ukulele… even today! All you need to do is to:
* borrow a ukulele from a friend or buy one that feels right for you
* get in the right mindset to play and put aside your fears and doubts about playing
* tune your ukulele
* practise some chords starting with C
* practise a strumming pattern
* learn a song and enjoy yourself

## <a name="meditation"></a>Meditation
Meditation is a fun and relaxing way to spend your time in quarantine. Try lying down with your eyes closed and focusing on your breath, breathing in and out. This will help you lower stress levels, boost your mood, allow you to connect better with yourself and improve your focus.

## <a name="facetime"></a>Video call your long-distance friends
Do you remember the nights when you used to hang out for hours with your friends? Since that is not possible any more you can use the following software to replicate the group feeling:
- Skype
- FaceTime
- Microsoft Teams
- Zoom
- Discord
- Or check out these [open source alternatives](https://opensource.com/alternatives/skype)

Virtual Activities:
- Sing karaoke 

This is pretty much self-explanatory. Pick a song, find its karaoke version on YouTube and sing along! Tip: make sure everyone else's microphones are mute.

- Disguised party 

This can go in two ways. You can discuss with the group the theme of disguise for your next group call and everyone dresses accordingly OR each person picks their costume individually. It feels just like Halloween! How fun!

- PowerPoint party 

Essentially, everyone picks a topic near and dear to their heart —the more niche, the better— and prepare a five-minute PowerPoint presentation on it. Here's some fun and interesting ideas: Drunk history, The best [whatever] of all time, Ranking and rating my exes, How HSM changed my life

- Movie/series night 

Watch a movie or a series with your group of friends without leaving your home, just by screen sharing in a video call or using streaming platforms like Netflix Party. Plus, you can comment on it in chat without disturbing others.

## <a name="writing"></a> Writing
Writing is a skill that I consider to be underestimated. Written communication is everywhere around us; in emails, articles or even in remote work where slack messages are the default form of communication.
There are many types of content produced by writing, like for example:
- Novels
- Short stories
- Academic papers
- Personal journals: Here are some journaling prompts to help your reflection journey:
	- What are the 3 biggest lessons you've learned over the last year?
	- Write down 10 things no one knows about you.
	- Close your eyes and take yourself on your favourite walk. What do you observe?
	- What is a resolution you made in January that you have let slip? How can you pick it back up?
	- What gives you hope for the rest of this year? Why is 2021 a good one?
	- What are your 10 favourite things about yourself?
	- Look around your room. What are you grateful for today in the ordinary?
- Technology documentations
- Blog posts
- And the list goes on

Writing is most often a solitary activity, except for people who like to write in cafe's. The ongoing lockdown is a great opportunity to start practicing writing. I will kick it off with one important tip that I've found to be helpful whenever I'm writing something for other people to read.

__Editing__ and __Writing__ are not the same thing. Whenever you write something, leave it for a few hours or maybe a few days. And then come back to it as an __editor__ to find ways to make it more captivating and understandable for the readers.

## <a name="erasmus"></a>Plan your Erasmus
An Erasmus exchange is a great way to step out of your comfort zone. Specifically, you will get a taste of living abroad, make valuable new connections from all over the world,
improve a foreign language or two, experience university life in a foreign institution and most importantly have the time of your LIFE!

<img src="media/images/erasmus.jpg" alt="erasmus" width="500"/>

Start by visiting the [university page](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/el/dmst/content/%CF%80%CF%81%CF%8C%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%BC%CE%BC%CE%B1-erasmus), which includes lots of information
about the procedure and the available destinations. Before you decide on your top 3 destinations, it is recommended to write down the pros and cons of all the
universities you are interested in. In case you need more information on a university or country you can check [this facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2069463463353183)
and the [ESN AUEB page](https://www.facebook.com/ESNAthensAUEB), where you can ask to be connected to students with erasmus experiences in the universities that you are interested in.
Lastly, you can also check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IilqhLVRP6U&t=3s&ab_channel=LosAngie) in order to get more information on how to apply for an erasmus exchange.

## <a name="cocktails"></a> Cocktail Adventures!
Let's be honest, Covid-19 pandemic and its several back-to-back lockdowns have been harsh for the most of us. Being in front of a screen for hours, unable to get in physical touch with our beloved ones and having our favorite restaurants and bars closed is an everyday struggle. After all that, the need to pour a glass (or two) of wine before bedtime comes naturally. 

So, we are here to just say that we understand and that it's time to level up the game; Cocktail adventure nights! Do you want to advance you bartender skills or feel like a little kid again? Well, as you discover new tasty horizons and mix up your favorite ingredients, the art of mixology will start to unfold and we promise you to enjoy those lockdown days as they are passing by. 

* Organize your space.

   First things first; Before you start your mixing experiments, you need to set up your working station. There are not many things requiered for that, just the basic bar essentials and spirits of your preference.  
   - Bar essentials: 
      1. Bar Spoons. You may already have some long-handle teaspoons but if you don't, you can find them [here](https://www.amazon.com/Hiware-Stirring-Stainless-Cocktail-Pattern/dp/B01EL7NAYU/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=bar+spoons&qid=1567433894&s=gateway&sr=8-9).
      2. Bottle opener & corkscrew. We are pretty sure everyone has at least one bottle opener of any kind. [Here](https://www.amazon.com/WHELVE-Mounted-Magnetic-Functional-Upcycled/dp/B07NQRGVTR/ref=sr_1_19_sspa?keywords=wall+mounted+bar+bottle+opener&qid=1567439614&s=gateway&sr=8-19-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExQlU3VFdCSTJUT1E0JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTc3NjgzMVRYV0VQWFJVSjIxWCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNDk1MjY2M1FHM0hTV0ZPM0VFVSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX210ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) is an extra idea if you are looking for something new.
      3. Cocktail shaker. Maybe the most important thing in a bar. For your homemade cocktails you probably won't need more than one shaker, which you can purchase [here](https://www.amazon.com/Boston-Cocktail-Shaker-Unweighted-Professional/dp/B07QFT835K/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=bar+cocktail+shaker&qid=1567440752&s=gateway&sr=8-7).
      4. Cocktail strainer. If your cocktail shaker doesn’t come with a built-in strainer, you’ll definitly need one of these to create cold ice-free drinks. We suggest something stainless like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Hawthorne-Cocktail-Strainer-Professional-Mixologists/dp/B06WGNF3SX/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=bar+cocktail+strainer&qid=1567441714&s=gateway&sr=8-4).
      5. Cutting board. That's an easy one too. Most kitchens are equipped with a wood cutting board, but [here](https://www.amazon.com/Cutting-Board-Food-Prep-Restaurantware/dp/B075S5CX16/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=bar+cutting+board&qid=1567433589&s=gateway&sr=8-6) is a fresh suggestion to cut your cocktail garnishes. With a cutting board you provide your bar not only a hygienic and safe surface for cutting, but also you can avoid making a mess to your kitchen.
      6. Ice crusher. It's a must when making cold cocktails. Having an ice crusher is the ideal way to crush ice to the right consistency for your signature cocktails. [This one](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Treats-Iceberg-crusher-white/dp/B087VJ13WB/ref=sr_1_1?_encoding=UTF8&c=ts&dchild=1&keywords=Blenders+%26+Ice+Crushers&qid=1616503456&s=kitchen&sr=1-1&ts_id=289732) is portable and doesn’t take up much room. Alternatively, you can buy crushed ice, however this can increase your budget.
      7. Jigger. It is not as necessary as one might think, because the more cocktails you make the more familiar you become with the liquid doses. However, if you want to get some jiggers as a beginner mixologist or to be more professional one, then [this set](https://www.amazon.com/CucinaPrime-Cocktail-Jigger-Stainless-Steel/dp/B00VCBM4TQ/ref=sr_1_11?keywords=jigger&qid=1567444723&s=gateway&sr=8-11) is what you are looking for.
      8. Muddler. Your homemade bar requires a muddler,[like this](https://www.amazon.com/Extra-Long-Cocktail-Muddler-Professional/dp/B07DMFH8SF/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=muddler&qid=1567433016&s=gateway&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzRU5SODNEUTJQVThUJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUExMDM0ODMyTzFJVTJXMEVCM0ZSJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA0ODY0MjgzSDVJMUFCNFJZQTExJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) if you want to bring out the aromatics of herbs and spices so that their flavors are released and infused into your cocktails.
      9. Rimmer. If you’re making margaritas and other drinks that require a rimmed glass edge, for a low budget you can always use a plate filled with salt or sugar, but [here](https://www.amazon.com/Greenco-Glass-Rimmer-Margarita-Cocktail/dp/B016YM64JI/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=rimmer+for+bar&qid=1567448578&s=gateway&sr=8-15) is a more professional option.
      10. Proper kind of glasses. Last but not least, your bar will need the specific glasses to pour your creations, like Coupe Glasses, Single & Double Rocks Glasses, Highball & Collins Glasses, Nick & Nora Glasses and of course Shot glasses. Our suggetion is, if you don't have any of this kinds, to purchase just a pair of each and get more as your cocktail adventures proceed.[Here are the types of Cocktail Glasses You Actually Need](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-cocktail-glass-types.html).
