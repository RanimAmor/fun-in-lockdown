Music is probably the best way to survive while at home. Whether you headbang while doing your assignments, sing at the shower or leave the computer to stretch your fingers with that chord, you have probably already noticed that slight brightening to your soul.

### Musical Instruments
You are never actually too old to learn to play an instrument you have always liked. It is a perfect break from your laptop's screen.

## Before you head outside
1. *Be sure you wear a mask*
2. *Don't forget to sent the obligatory SMS text message to 13033*:
You can send SMS from your mobile phone to 13033 free of charge.
The SMS must be in the following format:

        X [blank] full name and home address

    where X is the reason for movement 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 corresponding to the following reasons:

    1. Movement to the pharmacy or visiting a doctor or to donate blood, in the case that this is recommended after a previous communication.
    2. Movement to an in-service supply store of basic goods (supermarket, mini-market), where they cannot be sent out.
    3. Movement to a public service or bank, insofar as electronic transaction is not possible.
    4. Movement to help people in need or escort minors to/from school.
    5. Movement to a funeral ceremony under the conditions laid down by law or movement of divorced or separated parents necessary to ensure communication between parents and children, in accordance with the provisions in force.
    6. Physical exercise outdoors or movement with a pet, individually or per three persons, in the latter case having regard to the necessary distance of 1.5 m.

    You will receive the following in response:

        Movement [blank] X [blank] full name and address of residence
