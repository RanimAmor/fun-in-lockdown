## <a name="board-games"></a>Board Games
Board Games are great way to have fun and spend your time with family and friends!

### Online board games
Below you may find some interesting websites where you can play different board games along with your friends:

* [Scribbl](https://skribbl.io/): skribbl.io is a free multiplayer drawing and guessing game. One game consists of a few rounds in which every round someone has to draw their chosen word and others have to guess it to gain points! The person with the most points at the end of game will then be crowned as the winner! (*Source: https://skribbl.io/)*
* [Playing cards](https://playingcards.io/): PlayingCards.io simply provides a synchronized card playspace. It's up to you to start the game, enforce rules, and determine the winner, just like a real deck of cards!
* [Rento](https://playrento.com/): Rento is online multiplayer monopoly clone. The game is for 2 to 6 players and you can play it online versus friends, offline versus bots. In the game you trade lands, build houses, win auctions, go and most importantly - have fun. Your goal is to acquire monopoly and bankrupt the other players. (*Source: https://playrento.com/*)
* [Pretend you 're xyzzy](https://pyx-1.pretendyoure.xyz/zy/game.jsp): Pretend You're Xyzzy is a Cards Against Humanity clone! *([github repo](https://github.com/ajanata/PretendYoureXyzzy))*

### Classic board games
If you are stuck at home with your family or your roommate(s), you could try one of these fun board games:

* [Clue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo): A suspenseful murder mystery game that turns everyone into a detective.
* [Taboo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo_(game)): The game of forbidden words. In Taboo, your goal is to get your teammate to say the word written on one of the game cards without saying that word or any of the “taboo” words also listed with it.
* [Twister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twister_(game)): As the box promises, have you twisted up in knots and probably doubled over laughing, too.
* [Stratego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratego): A Napoleonic version of capture the flag!

## <a name="music"></a>Music
Music is probably the best way to survive while at home. Whether you headbang while doing your assignments, sing in the shower or leave the computer to stretch your fingers with that chord, you have probably already noticed that slight brightening to your soul.

### Musical Instruments
You are never actually too old to learn to play an instrument you have always liked. It is a perfect break from your laptop's screen.

#### Guitar
You will get surprised from how easily you can produce nice sounds. All you need to begin is:
* a [tuning app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ovelin.guitartuna&hl=en&gl=US)
* a set of strings
* a footstool (recommended for classical guitar)
* and of course the guitar

You can either teach yourself with a huge collection of online tutorials and tabs or find a teacher and have online lessons. You can check out [Kurt Berg's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOSmaT73sJrjOmf6PHjxVAQ) YouTube channel for easy beginner tutorials.

There are 3 major guitar types:

* *Nylon acoustic (classical):* It produces a mellow sound and it's ideal for beginners, as the strings are easy to pick and it is lightweight and cheap. However, it has wider fretboard.
* *Steel string acoustic:* The strings produce a brighter tone and they are ideal for strumming. However, building calluses can be really painful for beginners.
* *Electric:* You will need at least an amp as the sound is produced from electric signals. It also uses steel strings and it is a bit heavier. Nonetheless, it is great for creativity with many technics and effects.

<img align="left" width="40" height="40" src="media/icons/art.png">

## <a name="art"></a>Art
Creating art can be of so many different types. It can be painting, constructing some art piece from recycled 
materials, or also decorating your apartment/room. Especially painting can calm you really down and give you the 
opportunity to express your feelings and emotions by using colors. The following tutorials will help you to make 
the first step to become an artist and use the time during the pandemic more efficiently:

* [Acrylic Painting Tutorial - Ocean Sunset (Beginner to Intermediate)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjCGJb5ltZM)

## <a name="clean"></a> Clean and organize
This is a great opportunity for you to clean and organize your space. Declutter, get rid of all the things you never use and organize the ones that you use. It will make you feel useful and you will have a clean, organized space at the end of the day.

<img align="left" width="40" height="40" src="media/icons/pen.png">

## <a name="writing"></a> Writing
Writing is a skill that I consider to be underestimated. Written communication is everywhere around us; in emails, articles or even in remote work where slack messages are the default form of communication.
There are many types of content produced by writing, like for example:
- Novels
- Short stories
- Academic papers
- Personal journals
- Technology documentations
- Blog posts
- And the list goes on

Writing is most often a solitary activity, except for people who like to write in cafe's. The ongoing lockdown is a great opportunity to start practicing writing. I will kick it off with one important tip that I've found to be helpful whenever I'm writing something for other people to read.

__Editing__ and __Writing__ are not the same thing. Whenever you write something, leave it for a few hours or maybe a few days. And then come back to it as an __editor__ to find ways to make it more captivating and understandable for the readers.
